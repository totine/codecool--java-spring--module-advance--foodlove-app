# FoodLove

FoodLove tackles food waste in Cracow.

Every day many restaurants, coffeeshops, shops throwing away the dishes they can't sell the next day. With this app we can prevent wasting this food - few hours before the restaurants or shops are closing they can sell this food at discount price to take out. With this app restaurants, coffeeshops and food shops owners can offer unsold perishable food to customers at discount prices. Every customer will be able to find interesting food to lower prices, book it and it will be not wasted.
